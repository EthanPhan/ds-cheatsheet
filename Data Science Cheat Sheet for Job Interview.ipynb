    "\n",
    "Then for prediction, it compares an observation against that splitting value in a “node”, that node will have two node children on which another random comparisons will be made. The number of “splittings” made by the algorithm for an instance is named: “path length”. As expected, outliers will have shorter path lengths than the rest of the observations.\n",

    "A forest is build by constructing many trees and average them out.\n",

    "- The data contains noise which might be similar to abnormal behavior, because the boundary between normal and abnormal behavior is often not precise.\n",
    "- The definition of abnormal or normal may frequently change, as malicious adversaries constantly adapt themselves. Therefore, the threshold based on moving average may not always apply.\n",
    "- The pattern is based on seasonality. This involves more sophisticated methods, such as decomposing the data into multiple trends in order to identify the change in seasonality.\n",

    "\n",
    "The t test tells you how significant the differences between groups are; In other words it lets you know if those differences (measured in means/averages) could have happened by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Student’s T-tests can be used in real life to compare means. For example, a drug company may want to test a new cancer drug to find out if it improves life expectancy. In an experiment, there’s always a control group (a group who are given a placebo, or “sugar pill”). The control group may show an average life expectancy of +5 years, while the group taking the new drug might have a life expectancy of +6 years. It would seem that the drug might work. But it could be due to a fluke. To test this, researchers would use a Student’s t-test to find out if the results are repeatable for an entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. T score\n",
    "\n",
    "The t score is a ratio between the difference between two groups and the difference within the groups. The larger the t score, the more difference there is between groups. The smaller the t score, the more similarity there is between groups. A t score of 3 means that the groups are three times as different from each other as they are within each other. When you run a t test, the bigger the t-value, the more likely it is that the results are repeatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A large t-score tells you that the groups are different.\n",
    "* A small t-score tells you that the groups are similar.\n",

    "## 2. T-Values and P-values\n",
    "\n",
    "How big is “big enough”? Every t-value has a p-value to go with it. A p-value is the probability that the results from your sample data occurred by chance. P-values are from 0% to 100%. They are usually written as a decimal. For example, a p value of 5% is 0.05. Low p-values are good; They indicate your data did not occur by chance. For example, a p-value of .01 means there is only a 1% probability that the results from an experiment happened by chance. In most cases, a p-value of 0.05 (5%) is accepted to mean the data is valid.\n",

    "* A **chi-square test for independence** compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.\n",
    "  * A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. In other words, there is a relationship.\n",
    "  * A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. In other words, there isn’t a relationship.\n",

    "The summation symbol means that you’ll have to perform a calculation for every single data item in your data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi square test will give you a **p-value**. The p-value will tell you if your test results are significant or not. In order to perform a chi square test and get the p-value, you need two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Degrees of freedom**. That’s just the number of categories minus 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Chi-Square goodness of fit test is a non-parametric test that is used to find out how the observed value of a given phenomena is significantly different from the expected value.  In Chi-Square goodness of fit test, the term goodness of fit is used to compare the observed sample distribution with the expected probability distribution.  Chi-Square goodness of fit test determines how well theoretical distribution (such as normal, binomial, or Poisson) fits the empirical distribution. In Chi-Square goodness of fit test, sample data is divided into intervals. Then the numbers of points that fall into the interval are compared, with the expected numbers of points in each interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: Set up the hypothesis for Chi-Square goodness of fit test:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A. **Null hypothesis**: In Chi-Square goodness of fit test, the null hypothesis assumes that there is no significant difference between the observed and the expected value.\n",
    "* B. **Alternative hypothesis**: In Chi-Square goodness of fit test, the alternative hypothesis assumes that there is a significant difference between the observed and the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: Compute the value of Chi-Square goodness of fit test using the following formula:\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i}\\left [ \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\right ]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "**Degree of freedom:** $d = n - 1 - k$ where n is the number of intervals (or number of categories of the variable), k is the number of parameters that we calculated using the data.

    "## 2. Chi squared test of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square test of independence is used to determine if there is a significant relationship between two nominal (categorical) variables.

The data can be displayed in a contingency table where each row represents a category for one variable and each column represents a category for the other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say a researcher wants to examine the relationship between gender (male vs. female) and empathy (high vs. low).  The chi-square test of independence can be used to examine this relationship.  The null hypothesis for this test is that there is no relationship between gender and empathy.  The alternative hypothesis is that there is a relationship between gender and empathy (e.g. there are more high-empathy females than high-empathy males).\n",

    "\n",
    "**At test time**: Use a single neural net at test time without dropout. The weights of this network are scaled-down versions of the trained weights. If a unit is retained with probability p during training, the outgoing weights of that unit are multiplied by p at test time. This ensures that for any hidden unit the expected output (under the distribution used to drop units at training time) is the same as the actual output at test time.\n",

This is because after one or more layer, the data starts to suffer from what author called 'covariance shift' which is different features has different scale => take longer to train using gradient descent.\n",
